# Hi, I’m JC (jaayseee) 👋

I’m a **BCom student at UBC Sauder (BTM / Business Analytics)** building a career in **cybersecurity**—with a strong interest in **SOC-style investigations, cloud security fundamentals, and security operations automation**.

I like turning messy, real-world processes into **clear, auditable, repeatable workflows**—whether that’s access reviews, monitoring tasks, dashboards, or lightweight tooling that reduces manual effort.

---

## What I’m focused on right now
- Building a **cyber portfolio** (labs + writeups + small tools)
- Improving **hands-on security ops skills** (logs, detection mindset, triage)
- Strengthening **networking + cloud foundations**
- Writing projects in a way that’s **easy for recruiters to scan** (screenshots + short reports + GitHub repos)

---

## Experience snapshot
- **Cybersecurity Risk & Compliance Co-op** — BC Hydro  
  Worked on security/compliance workflows, monitoring/reporting tasks, documentation, and process improvements (sanitized for portfolio use).
- **Data Analyst Co-op** — Optima Living
